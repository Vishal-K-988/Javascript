Suppose you have a CommonJS module that exports a function *getFullName* as seen below:

// utils.js
const getFullName = (firstname, lastName) => {
    return `My fullname is ${firstname} ${lastName}`;
};
module.exports = getFullName;
Then you can use the require() function to use/include this module within your JavaScript file:

// index.js
const getFullName = require('./utils.js');
console.log(getFullName('John', 'Doe')); // My fullname is John Doe
The module is located within a local file in the above code, which is why the local address is referenced using the file name.
